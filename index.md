# Sarai Figueroa

Welcome to my personal website! :)


I’m currently completing my PhD in mathematics at the Freie Universität Berlin in the research group [Mathematics for Sustainability Transitions](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ag-math4susTrans/index.html) of Prof. Sarah Wolf.

For my research I develop and analyze agent-based models to understand the foundations of the emergence of economic green transitions. 

## Agent-Based Models

- [Agent-Based Ramsey growth model with Brown and Green capital (ABRam-BG)](https://www.comses.net/codebases/44bc2da3-a186-4bf3-8e8e-08e4b3fe81fa/releases/1.0.0/) (December 2025)
- [Agent-Based Ramsey growth model with endogenous technical progress (ABRam-T)](https://www.comses.net/codebases/0d2d9f03-e579-4d59-bd9a-35be1439f8ed/releases/1.1.0/) (February 2024)
