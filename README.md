## Welcome to my personal website!


I’m currently completing my PhD in mathematics at the Freie Universität Berlin in the research group "Mathematics for Sustainability Transtions".
For my research I develop and analyze agent-based models to understand complex socio-economic systems with a particular focus on the economic green transition.
