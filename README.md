## Welcome to my personal website!

I’m a curious and passionate researcher who wants to solve real-world problems by applying rigorous analytical tools.

I’m currently completing my PhD in mathematics, where I develop and analyze agent-based models to understand complex economic systems with a particular focus on the economic green transition.
